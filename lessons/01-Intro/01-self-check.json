[{"question": "What is the purpose of variables in Python programming?", "type": "multiple_choice", "code": null, "table": null, "precision": null, "answers": [{"answer": "To make the code look more professional", "correct": false, "feedback": "While good variable names improve code readability, that's not their primary purpose."}, {"answer": "To store data so it can be used across different lines of code", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct!

Their purpose is to store and manage data."}, {"answer": "To automatically fix errors in code", "correct": false, "feedback": "Variables don't fix errors.

You must assign it to a variable to use it."}, {"answer": "The input is collected but cannot be used later because it wasn't stored", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct!
